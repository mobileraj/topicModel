                        We keep our cash largely in U.S. Treasury bills and avoid other short-term securities yielding a few
                more basis points, a policy we adhered to long before the frailties of commercial paper and money market funds
                became apparent in September 2008. We agree with investment writer Ray DeVoe¿ês observation, ‚ÄúMore money
                has been lost reaching for yield than at the point of a gun.‚Äù At Berkshire, we don¿êt rely on bank lines, and we
                don¿êt enter into contracts that could require postings of collateral except for amounts that are tiny in relation to
                our liquid assets.
                        Furthermore, not a dime of cash has left Berkshire for dividends or share repurchases during the past
                40 years. Instead, we have retained all of our earnings to strengthen our business, a reinforcement now running
                about $1 billion per month. Our net worth has thus increased from $48 million to $157 billion during those four
                decades and our intrinsic value has grown far more. No other American corporation has come close to building
                up its financial strength in this unrelenting way.
                        By being so cautious in respect to leverage, we penalize our returns by a minor amount. Having loads of
                liquidity, though, lets us sleep well. Moreover, during the episodes of financial chaos that occasionally erupt in our
                economy, we will be equipped both financially and emotionally to play offense while others scramble for survival.
                That¿ês what allowed us to invest $15.6 billion in 25 days of panic following the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008.

                        The annual meeting will be held on Saturday, April 30 . Carrie Kizer from our home office will be the
                ringmaster, and her theme this year is Planes, Trains and Automobiles. This gives NetJets, BNSF and BYD a
                chance to show off.
                        Asalways, the doors will open at the Qwest Center at 7 a.m., and a new Berkshire movie will be shown at
                8:30. At 9:30 we will go directly to the question-and-answer period, which (with a break for lunch at the Qwest¿ês
                stands) will last until 3:30. After a short recess, Charlie and I will convene the annual meeting at 3:45. If you decide
                to leave during the day¿ês question periods, please do so whileCharlie is talking. (Act fast; he can be terse.)
                        The best reason to exit, of course, is to shop. We will help you do that by filling the 194,300-square-
                foot hall that adjoins the meeting area with products from dozens of Berkshire subsidiaries. Last year, you did
                your part, and most locations racked up record sales. In a nine-hour period, we sold 1,053 pairs of Justin boots,
                12,416 pounds of See¿ês candy, 8,000 Dairy Queen Blizzards¿Æ and 8,800 Quikut knives (that¿ês 16 knives per
                minute). But you can do better. Remember: Anyone who says money can¿êt buy happiness simply hasn¿êt learned
                where to shop.
                        GEICO will have a booth staffed by a number of its top counselors from around the country, all of
                them ready to supply you with auto insurance quotes. In most cases, GEICO will be able to give you a
                shareholder discount (usually 8%). This special offer is permitted by 44 of the 51 jurisdictions in which we
                operate. (One supplemental point: The discount is not additive if you qualify for another, such as that given
                certain groups.) Bring the details of your existing insurance and check out whether we can save you money. For
                at least half of you, I believe we can.
                        Be sure to visit the Bookworm. It will carry more than 60 books and DVDs, including the Chinese
                language edition of Poor Charlie¿ês Almanack, the ever-popular book about my partner. So what if you can¿êt read
                Chinese? Just buy a copy and carry it around; it will make you look urbane and erudite. Should you need to ship
                your book purchases, a shipping service will be available nearby.
                        If you are a big spender ‚Äì or merely a gawker ‚Äì visit Elliott Aviation on the east side of the Omaha
                airport between noon and 5:00 p.m. on Saturday. There we will have a fleet of NetJets aircraft that will get your
                pulse racing. Come by bus; leave by private jet.

                         An attachment to the proxy material that is enclosed with this report explains how you can obtain the
                 credential you will need for admission to the meeting and other events. As for plane, hotel and car reservations,
                 we have again signed up American Express (800-799-6634) to give you special help. Carol Pedersen, who
                 handles these matters, does a terrific job for us each year, and I thank her for it. Hotel rooms can be hard to find,
                 but work with Carol and you will get one.
                         Airlines have often jacked up prices ‚Äì sometimes dramatically so ‚Äì for the Berkshire weekend. If you
                                                                                                       1
                 are coming from far away, compare the cost of flying to Kansas City versus Omaha. The drive is about 2 ‚ÅÑ2 hours
                 and it may be that you can save significant money, particularly if you had planned to rent a car in Omaha.
                                                                            nd
                         At Nebraska Furniture Mart, located on a 77-acre site on 72Street between Dodge and Pacific, we
                 will again be having ‚ÄúBerkshire Weekend‚Äù discount pricing. Last year the store did $33.3 million of business
                 during its annual meeting sale, a volume that ‚Äì as far as I know ‚Äì exceeds the one-week totalanyof retail store
                                                                                                          th
                 anyplace. To obtain the Berkshire discount, you must make your purchases between Tuesday, Apriland26
                              nd
                 Monday, May 2 inclusive, and also present your meeting credential. The period¿ês special pricing will even
                 apply to the products of several prestigious manufacturers that normally have ironclad rules against
                 discounting but which, in the spirit of our shareholder weekend, have made an exception for you.
                 Weappreciate their cooperation. NFM is open from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 10 a.m.
                 to 6 p.m. on Sunday. On Saturday this year, from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., NFM is having a picnic to which you are
                 all invited.
                         At Borsheims, we will again have two shareholder-only events. The first will be a cocktail reception
                                                    th                                                  st
                 from6p.m.to9p.m.onFriday,Ap.rTilhe29second, the main gala, will be held on Sunday, May 1, from
                 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On Saturday, we will be open until 6 p.m. On Sunday, around 1 p.m., I will be at Borsheims
                 with a smile and a shoeshine, selling jewelry just as I sold men¿ês shirts at J.C. Penney¿ês 63 years ago.
                 I¿êve told Susan Jacques, Borsheims¿ê CEO, that I¿êm still a hotshot salesman. But I see doubt in her eyes.
                 So cut loose and buy something from me for your wife or sweetheart (presumably the same person). Make me
                 look good.
                         We will have huge crowds at Borsheims throughout the weekend. For your convenience, therefore,
                                                                    th                      th
                 shareholder prices will be available from Monday, April 25through Saturday, May 7 . During that period,
                 please identify yourself as a shareholder by presenting your meeting credentials or a brokerage statement that
                 shows you are a Berkshire shareholder.
                         OnSunday, in the mall outside of Borsheims, a blindfolded Patrick Wolff, twice U.S. chess champion,
                 will take on all comers ‚Äì who will have their eyes wide open ‚Äì in groups of six. Nearby, Norman Beck, a
                 remarkable magician from Dallas, will bewilder onlookers. Additionally, we will have Bob Hamman and Sharon
                 Osberg, two of the world¿ês top bridge experts, available to play bridge with our shareholders on Sunday
                 afternoon.
                         Gorat¿ês and Piccolo¿ês will again be open exclusively for Berkshire shareholders on Sunday, May 1st.
                 Both will be serving until 10 p.m., with Gorat¿ês opening at 1 p.m. and Piccolo¿ês opening at 4 p.m. These
                 restaurants are my favorites and ‚Äì still being a growing boy ‚Äì I will eat at both of them on Sunday evening.
                                                                                 st
                 Remember: To make a reservation at Gorat¿ês, call 402-551-3733 on April 1 (but not before) and at Piccolo¿ês
                 call 402-342-9038.
                         We will again have the same three financial journalists lead the question-and-answer period, asking
                 Charlie and me questions that shareholders have submitted to them by e-mail. The journalists and their e-mail
                 addresses are: Carol Loomis, of Fortune, who may be emailed at cloomis@fortunemail.com; Becky Quick, of
                 CNBC, at BerkshireQuestions@cnbc.com, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, of The New York Times, at
                 arsorkin@nytimes.com.
                         From the questions submitted, each journalist will choose the dozen or so he or she decides are the
                 most interesting and important. The journalists have told me your question has the best chance of being selected
                 if you keep it concise, avoid sending it in at the last moment, make it Berkshire-related and include no more than
                 two questions in any email you send them. (In your email, let the journalist know if you would like your name
                 mentioned if your question is selected.)
                         Neither Charlie nor I will get so much as a clue about the questions to be asked. We know the
                 journalists will pick some tough ones, and that¿ês the way we like it.
                                                              25
            We will again have a drawing at 8:15 a.m. on Saturday at each of 13 microphones for those
        shareholders wishing to ask questions themselves. At the meeting, I will alternate the questions asked by the
        journalists with those from the winning shareholders. We hope to answer at least 60 questions. From our
        standpoint, the more the better. Our goal, which we pursue both through these annual letters and by our meeting
        discussions, is to give you a better understanding of the business that you own.
                           ************
            For good reason, I regularly extol the accomplishments of our operating managers. Equally important,
        however, are the 20 men and women who work with me at our corporate office (all on one floor, which is the
        wayweintendtokeepit!).
            This group efficiently deals with a multitude of SEC and other regulatory requirements, files a 14,097-
        page Federal income tax return along with state and foreign returns, responds to countless shareholder and media
        inquiries, gets out the annual report, prepares for the country¿ês largest annual meeting, coordinates the Board¿ês
        activities ‚Äì and the list goes on and on.
            They handle all of these business tasks cheerfully and with unbelievable efficiency, making my life
        easy and joyful. Their efforts go beyond activities strictly related to Berkshire: They deal with 48 universities
        (selected from 200 applicants) who will send students to Omaha this school year for a day with me and also
        handle all kinds of requests that I receive, arrange my travel, and even get me hamburgers for lunch. No CEO has
        it better.
            This home office crew has my deepest thanks and deserves yours as well. Come to our Woodstock for
        Capitalism on April 30thand tell them so.
        February 26, 2011   Warren E. Buffett
                            Chairman of the Board
                               26
     Memo
     To:  Berkshire Hathaway Managers (‚ÄúThe All-Stars‚Äù)
     cc:  Berkshire Directors
     From: WarrenE.Buffett
     Date:July 26, 2010
          This is my biennial letter to reemphasize Berkshire¿ês top priority and to get your help on
     succession planning (yours, not mine!).
          The priority is that all of us continue to zealously guard Berkshire¿ês reputation. We can¿êt be
     perfect but we can try to be. As I¿êve said in these memos for more than 25 years: ‚ÄúWe can afford to lose
     money ‚Äì even a lot of money. But we can¿êt afford to lose reputation ‚Äì even a shred of reputation.‚Äù We
     must continue to measure every act against not only what is legal but also what we would be happy to have
     written about on the front page of a national newspaper in an article written by an unfriendly but intelligent
     reporter.
          Sometimes your associates will say ‚ÄúEverybody else is doing it.‚Äù This rationale is almost always
     a bad one if it is the main justification for a business action. It is totally unacceptable when evaluating a
     moral decision. Whenever somebody offers that phrase as a rationale, in effect they are saying that they
     can¿êt come up with a good reason. If anyone gives this explanation, tell them to try using it with a reporter
     or a judge and see how far it gets them.
          If you see anything whose propriety or legality causes you to hesitate, be sure to give me a call.
     However, it¿ês very likely that if a given course of action evokes such hesitation, it¿ês too close to the line
     and should be abandoned. There¿ês plenty of money to be made in the center of the court. If it¿ês
     questionable whether some action is close to the line, just assume it is outside and forget it.
          As a corollary, let me know promptly if there¿ês any significant bad news. I can handle bad news
     but I don¿êt like to deal with it after it has festered for awhile. A reluctance to face up immediately to bad
     news is what turned a problem at Salomon from one that could have easily been disposed of into one that
     almost caused the demise of a firm with 8,000 employees.
                               104
          Somebody is doing something today at Berkshire that you and I would be unhappy about if we
     knew of it. That¿ês inevitable: We now employ more than 250,000 people and the chances of that number
     getting through the day without any bad behavior occurring is nil. But we can have a huge effect in
     minimizing such activities by jumping on anything immediately when there is the slightest odor of
     impropriety. Your attitude on such matters, expressed by behavior as well as words, will be the most
     important factor in how the culture of your business develops. Culture, more than rule books, determines
     howanorganization behaves.
          In other respects, talk to me about what is going on as little or as much as you wish. Each of you
     does a first-class job of running your operation with your own individual style and you don¿êt need me to
     help. The only items you need to clear with me are any changes in post-retirement benefits and any
     unusually large capital expenditures or acquisitions.
                          ************
          I need your help in respect to the question of succession. I¿êm not looking for any of you to retire
     and I hope you all live to 100. (In Charlie¿ês case, 110.) But just in case you don¿êt, please send me a letter
     (at home if you wish) giving your recommendation as who should take over tomorrow if you should
     become incapacitated overnight. These letters will be seen by no one but me unless I¿êm no longer CEO, in
     which case my successor will need the information. Please summarize the strengths and weaknesses of
     your primary candidate as well as any possible alternates you may wish to include. Most of you have
     participated in this exercise in the past and others have offered your ideas verbally. However, it¿ês
     important to me to get a periodic update, and now that we have added so many businesses, I need to have
     your thoughts in writing rather than trying to carry them around in my memory. Of course, there are a few
     operations that are run by two or more of you ‚Äì such as the Blumkins, the Merschmans, the pair at Applied
     Underwriters, etc. ‚Äì and in these cases, just forget about this item. Your note can be short, informal,
     handwritten, etc. Just mark it ‚ÄúPersonal for Warren.‚Äù
          Thanks for your help on all of this. And thanks for the way you run your businesses. You make
     myjobeasy.
     WEB/db
     P.S. Another minor request: Please turn down all proposals for me to speak, make contributions, intercede
     with the Gates Foundation, etc. Sometimes these requests for you to act as intermediary will be
     accompanied by ‚ÄúIt can¿êt hurt to ask.‚Äù It will be easier for both of us if you just say ‚Äúno.‚Äù As an added
     favor, don¿êt suggest that they instead write or call me. Multiply 76 businesses by the periodic ‚ÄúI think he¿êll
     be interested in this one‚Äù and you can understand why it is better to say no firmly and immediately.
                               105
